# DESCRIPTION

This module generates TeamCity build messages.

See
[https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity#BuildScriptInteractionwithTeamCity-reportingMessagesForBuildLogReportingMessagesForBuildLog](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/TCD9/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity#BuildScriptInteractionwithTeamCity-reportingMessagesForBuildLogReportingMessagesForBuildLog)
for more details on TeamCity build messages.

# API

This module provides a single subroutine exported by default, `tc_message`,
which can be used to generate properly formatted and escaped TeamCity build
messages.

## tc\_message(...)

This subroutine accepts the following arguments:

- type

    This is the message type, such as "message", "testStarted", "testFinished",
    etc.

    This is required.

- content

    This can be either a string or a hash reference of key/value pairs. This will
    be turned into the content of the message.

    This is required.

When the `content` parameter is a hash reference, this subroutine will always
add a "timestamp" to the message matching the current time. You can provide an
explicit `timestamp` value in the `content` if you want to set this
yourself.
